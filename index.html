          <p class="c3-text">
            Born and raised in the Bay Area, CA, technology has been an integral
            part of my life from an early age. Surrounded by the constant
            evolution of electronics, I've developed a deep appreciation for the
            impact of technology on our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an
            associate's degree in communications alongside a certificate in
            computer science, with graduation slated for May 2024. Looking
            ahead, my goal is to transfer to a four-year institution to further
            explore the dynamic field of computer science. Eager to expand my
            skills and gain hands-on experience, I'm actively seeking internship
            opportunities for the summer of 2024. I'm excited to embark on new
            challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of
            technology.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of academics and technology, I enjoy pursuing various
            hobbies. In my free time, you can often find me taking photos in the
            beautiful Bay Area, experimenting with new coding languages. These
            activities not only offer me relaxation but also inspire creativity
            and foster personal growth.
